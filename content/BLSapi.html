		<H3>What is the BLS API?</H3>

		<p>BLS is the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. 
		It's a source of official employment information and statistics, for example information 
		about the unemployment rate or projected job growth rates for various job titles.</p>

		<p>The BLS API is a set of developer resources that "gives the public access to economic 
		data from all BLS programs." BLS provides <a href="http://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm" target="_blank">some documentation</a> to get started using their API, 
		and this how-to guide will walk you through the steps needed to get up and running with the
		BLS API.</p>
