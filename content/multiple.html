		<H3>Multiple Series</H3>

		<p>If you need to compare information for multiple series IDs, you 
		can send up to 50 series IDs in a single POST request, with or without 
		parameters.</p>
		
		<h3>Sending A RESTful Signature</h3>
		
		<p>When sending a signature with multiple series IDs, you should set 
		the header to Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded. In the 
		payload, the seriesID attribute will have the seriesIDs separated by 
		commas. See the code example below:</p>
		
		<div class="code-sample">
		<pre>
		var baseURL = 'http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/';
		var seriesIDs = ['OEUN000000054192027402104', 'OEUN000000054192027402103'];
		var signature = "seriesid=";
		for (var i = 0; i = seriesIDs.length; i++) {
			signature += seriesIDs[i] + ',';
		}
		signature = signature.substring(0,signature.length-1);
		
		var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
		req.open("POST", baseURL, false);
		req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
		req.send(signature);
		var results = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
		</pre>
		</div>
		
		<p>In this example, we are requesting the annual wage and hourly wage 
		data for photographers nationally, both from the same program. Notice that we specified 
		request as POST and set the content type. In the http request that we opened, we specified 
		the base URL but did not add the signature on in this place; instead, we used req.send(signature) 
		to send it because it's a POST request not a GET request.
		
		<h3>Sending a JSON Object</h3>
		
		<p>The other option for sending data with multiple series is a JSON object. 
		In this case, you need to set the header to Content-Type= application/json.
		The JSON object should be formatted with seriesID as an array of IDs and a 
		number of other fields. These include startyear as a string, endyear as 
		a string, catalog as a string, calculations as a boolean, and annualaverage as a boolean. Finally, 
		your registration key will go in the JSON object. calculations and annualaverage 
		are false by default.</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><strong>"startyear":</strong> the starting year of the requested data.</li>
		<li><strong>"endyear":</strong> the ending year of the requested data. If you 
		don't use a registration key, you'll be limited to a 10-year span of time in your 
		query.</li>
		<li><strong>"catalog":</strong> catalog data about the series.</li>
		<li><strong>"calculations":</strong> these calculations are the changes (percent 
		as well as net changes). These calculations, if available, will be provided for 
		time frames of 1, 3, 6, 12 months. This feature is new in Version 2.0 of the API.</li>
		<li><strong>"annualaverage":</strong> if available, you can set this field to true 
		to get annual averages of the requested data. This feature is also new in Version 2.0.</li>
		<li><strong>"registrationkey":</strong> if you want to use calculations or annualaverages, 
		you must include your registration key (as queries without a registration key are restricted 
		to version 1.0 of the API). The limit for number of series IDs in a query is 50 with a 
		registration key but only 25 without.
		</ul>
		
		<p>See the following for an example JSON object:</p>
		
		<div class="code-sample">
		<pre>
		{"seriesid":["OEUN000000054192027402104", "OEUN000000054192027402103"], 
		"startyear":"2000", 
		"endyear":"2010", 
		"catalog":true, 
		"calculations":false, 
		"annualaverage":false, 
		"registrationKey":"f6be152aed67442d986955e52e5419d0" }
		</pre>
		</div>
		
		<p>See the following for example code to send this request:</p>
		
		<div class="code-sample">
		<pre>
		var myRequest = '{"seriesid":["OEUN000000054192027402104", "OEUN000000054192027402103"], ' +
						' "startyear":"2000", ' +
						' "endyear":"2010", ' +
						' "catalog":true, ' +
						' "calculations":false, ' +
						' "annualaverage":false, ' +
						' "registrationKey":"f6be152aed67442d986955e52e5419d0" }';
		var baseURL = 'http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/';
		
		var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
		req.open("POST", baseURL, false);
		req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
		req.send(myRequest);
		var results = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
