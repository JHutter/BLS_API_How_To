		<H3>Series IDs</H3>

		<p>One of the problems with the BLS API, that makes it difficult to wade 
		through the existing documentation are the series IDs. As the 
		<a href="http://www.bls.gov/developers/api_faqs.htm#signatures3" target="_blank">BLS API FAQs</a>
		state, there isn't an easy list of series IDs, which are the only way to access the 
		information. However, the documentation does contain a page that explains the pattern that 
		series IDs follow. Based on the type of information the developer 
		is looking for, there are eight main categories, each with subcategories 
		whose format pattern is then explained (be prepared to wade through the 
		series ID <a href="http://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm" target="_blank">format page</a> to find the information you are looking for!).</p>
		
		<ul><strong>Series ID format categories</strong>
			<li>Employment and Unemployment</li>
			<li>Inflation and Prices</li>
			<li>Spending and Time Use</li>
			<li>Pay and Benefits</li>
			<li>Productivity</li>
			<li>Workplace Injuries</li>
			<li>International</li>
			<li>Projections</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Once you've figured out which of those top-level 
		categories, you'll have to choose a sub-category. For example, in 
		Spending and Time Use, we have the options American Time Use Survey and 
		Consumer Expenditure Survey. Choosing American Time Use Survey, BLS gives 
		an overview about this survey, and the format for seriesIDs inquiring about 
		it. See the example below:</p>
		
		<div class="code-sample">
		<pre>
		Series ID		TUU10101AA01011987
		Positions		Value 		Field Name
		1-2			TU			Prefix
		3			U 			Seasonal Adjustment Code 
		4-8			10101		Type of Estimate Code
		9 			A			Time Period Code
		10			A			All ATUS data series have the character "A."
		11-12		01			Number of years Code
		13-18		011987		Character Code
		</pre>
		</div>
		
		<p>We can see from this example, that the seriesID is 10 digits. The prefix to mark 
		the American Time Use Survey is TU. The following sections control factors such as the 
		seasonal adjustment code (U for unadjusted, S for seasonally adjusted), the type of 
		estimate, the time period (for example, A for annual), the number of years, and 
		an additional character code that filters the information by characteristics such 
		as age, labor force status, etc. While most of the information you will need is 
		there, it will require digging to find, along with some experimenting to fill in gaps 
		in the information, such as with the 6-character code.</p>
		
		<p>Each of the programs included in the BLS API has a seriesID prefix 
		and digit positions with relevant codes. It's worth it to dig through the 
		seriesID format because the seriesID is the most important part of requesting data through the 
		BLS API.</p>
