		<H3>Series IDs</H3>

		<p>One of the problems with the BLS API, that makes it difficult to wade 
		through the existing documentation are the series IDs. As the 
		<a href="http://www.bls.gov/developers/api_faqs.htm#signatures3" target="_blank">BLS API FAQs</a>
		state, there isn't an easy list of series IDs, which are the only way to access the 
		information. However, the documentation does contain a page that explains the pattern that 
		series IDs follow. Based on the type of information the developer 
		is looking for, there are eight main categories, each with subcategories 
		whose format pattern is then explained (be prepared to wade through the 
		series ID <a href="http://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm" target="_blank">format page</a> to find the information you are looking for!).</p>
		
		<ul><strong>Series ID format categories (subcategories are not comprehensive)</strong>
			<li>Employment and Unemployment</li>
			<li>Inflation and Prices</li>
			<li>Spending and Time Use</li>
			<li>Pay and Benefits</li>
			<li>Productivity</li>
			<li>Workplace Injuries</li>
			<li>International</li>
			<li>Projections</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Once you've figured out which of those top-level 
		categories, you'll have to choose a sub-category. For example, in 
		Spending and Time Use, we have the options American Time Use Survey and 
		Consumer Expenditure Survey. Choosing American Time Use Survey, BLS gives 
		an overview about this survey, and the format for seriesIDs inquiring about 
		it.</p>
