		<H3>Getting Started</H3>

		<p>Before we jump into this API, we need to cover a few things.</p>
		
		<h3>Registration Key</h3>
		
		<p>You can use the BLS API without signing up for a registration key, 
		but you will be limited to the older version of the API, as well as 
		limited in the number of requests per day. Since registering is easy and 
		unintrusive, it's better to go ahead and get a registration key by signing up 
		with your email and name or organization name. Later, you will use this 
		registration key in requests to the API.</p>

		<h3>Sending Requests and Receiving Data in Responses</h3>
		
		<p>The BLS API accepts RESTful signatures with either GET or POST HTTP type. 
		The base URL that you will use is http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/ . See the code example 
		for a very simple GET request below:</p>
		
		<div class="code-sample">
		<pre>
		var baseURL = 'http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/';
		var seriesID = 'LAUCN040010000000005';
		var signature = baseURL + seriesID;
		var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
		req.open("GET", signature, false);
		req.send(null);
		console.log(JSON.parse(req.responseText));
		</pre>
		</div>
		
		<p>The BLS API sends responses in one of two forms. One is XLSX, which 
		we won't cover in much detail here, but can be downloaded in the client 
		browser. The other format, which we will deal with primarily, is JSON format. 
		<a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON</a>, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a standardized object format for 
		transferring data. Notably, it consists of attribute-value pairs in which the attribute 
		consists of a string. Below is an example of a JSON object returned by the BLS API:</p>
		
		<div class="code-sample">
		<pre>
		{"status":"REQUEST_SUCCEEDED",
		"responseTime":34,
		"message":[],
		"Results":{
			"series": [
				{"seriesID":"LAUCN040010000000005",
				"data":[
					{"year":"2015",
					"period":"M12",
					"periodName":"December",
					"value":"17654",
					"footnotes":[{	"code":"R",
								"text":"Data were subject to revision on April 15, 2016."}]},
					
					{"year":"2015",
					"period":"M11",
					"periodName":"November",
					"value":"17765",
					"footnotes":[{	"code":"R",
								"text":"Data were subject to revision on April 15, 2016."}]}
				]}
			]
		}}
		</pre>
		</div>
		
		<p>Developers can then parse this data in order to extract useful parts, 
		for example, so generate a graph of values over a range of time. BLS API JSON objects 
		have predictable parts, which we'll jump more into interpreting when we get to responses.</p>
		
		<h2>A Note About An Issue</h2>
		
		<p>CORS, also known as Cross Origin Resource Sharing, is an issue using this API. 
		You can read more about CORS, a security measure to limit cross-domain requests 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">here.</a> 
		Unfortunately, setting the access control 
		header using req.setRequestHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); 
		will not work for the BLS API (but will for some other APIs). An option that will work but 
		is very limited is using Internet Explorer as a browswer (but obviously this is not always an option!). 
		Here is an example of the errors you will see:</p>
