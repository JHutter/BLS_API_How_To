		<p>Before we jump into this API, we need to cover a few things.</p>
		
		<h3>Registration Key</h3>
		
		<p>You can use the BLS API without signing up for a registration key, 
		but you will be limited to the older version of the API, as well as 
		limited in the number of requests per day. Since registering is easy and 
		unintrusive, it's better to go ahead and get a registration key by signing up 
		with your email and name or organization name. Later, you will use this 
		registration key in requests to the API.</p>

		<h3>Setting up GET and POST requests</h3>
		
		<p>The BLS API accepts RESTful signatures with either GET or POST HTTP type. 
		The base URL that you will use is http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/ . See the code example</p>
